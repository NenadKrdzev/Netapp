# Netapp
## Project description
This is a website I made for my Integrated Systems class.
This project resembles an e-shop built for the purpose of selling tickets. It is entirely made with C#.Net.
## Project features
* Client Side
1. User authorization: Enables users to log in or register if they don't have an existing account.
2. Ticket Purchase: Users can browse available tickets and view details before making purchases.
3. Ticket History: Provides an option for users to retrieve a record of all purchased tickets.
* Admin Side
1. User Data Retrieval: Grants the admin user the capability to download a list of all website users along with their usernames and emails.
2. Ticket Management: Empowers the admin user to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for tickets.
